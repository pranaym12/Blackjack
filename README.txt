1. I've decided to make Blackjack! 
It's a single player game, competing against the computer (AKA the dealer).

2. Instructions for running my code:
Open your terminal, and cd inside of the folder "Blackjack".
Run the file "blackjack.py" by typing in the terminal "python blackjack.py".
This will run the code, and follow the instructions provided.

3. Choice of tooling:
I wrote my code in Python 2.7x.
I chose Python for its ubiquity and my familiarity with the language.

4. -I chose to make Card, Hand, and Deck their own classes for the ease of 
creating a deck and dealing cards to a hand. 
This way, it would be easy to implement 2-player functionality in the future.
-Also, I use time.sleep() throughout the program to provide a slight pause while
info is printed. This way, it's easier for the user to distinguish between different info.
-Additionally, I chose not to implement splitting because it would be difficult
for the user to visualize in a terminal, instead of a GUI.
